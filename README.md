# Pneumonia-prediction-using-CNNS
 
The notebook in the repo can be considered as a tutorial for building a CNN using pytorch.
The dataset used was provided on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

Feel free to play with the numbers. Try building a bigger network, but it didn't work for me I don't know why. If you follow the exact same network as in the notebook you might get a final test accuracy around 80-82% which is not great but not bad either, it's just ok :))
